      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I have a passionate appreciation for reading comics and watching anime,
        which inspire my creativity with their unique storytelling and vibrant
        visuals. I also enjoy learning new languages, as it enhances my cultural
        understanding and communication skills. Additionally, reading novels
        allows me to explore different perspectives and enrich my appreciation
        for the human experience. Together, these interests fuel my curiosity
        and creativity.
